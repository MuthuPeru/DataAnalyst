## Quick overview

* Supports multi-file uploads; `questions.txt` (or similar) is required for analysis requests
* Multiple workflow types (data analysis, image analysis, code generation, EDA, predictive modeling, etc.)
* Synchronous processing for short-running tasks (service-level timeout / limits should be enforced separately)
